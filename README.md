Here I save little JavaScript projects I made

# First Project: Dice Game!
I made this little game of tossing dice to choose a winner!
Made with pure DOM and Javascript, the program will change the value of the dice everytime the page refresh, depending on a random number between 1 and 6.
The program will decide wich one is the winner or if it is a draw. You can check the project on your own downloading the files from the Dice Game folder!

That memory game where the machine does a certain pattern of colors that you have to press in the exact order or either you're gonna loose.
Made with the JQuery, the program make a pattern to the player to follow based on a random number and stores the pattern in an array, if the player follows the pattern the game continues, when the player make a mistake, the game's over.
