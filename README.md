# First Project: Dice Game!
I did this little game of tossing dice to choose a winner!
Made with pure DOM and Javascript, the program will change the value of the dice everytime the page refresh, depending on a random number between 1 and 6.
The program will decide wich one is the winner or if it is a draw.
